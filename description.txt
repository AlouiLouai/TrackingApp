- Implementing github actions in .github/workflow for both backend and frontend . 
- webpack + babel to bundle the frontend with its loaders . 
- dockerising the application + configuring docker for questdb
- Because I can't get the data from backend , I saw that when time is enough I focused on component , I have dummy data to visualize
- I succed to get from large json to csv file + I succed to import large csv by enabling COPY of questdb terminal 
- But the problem is that where I copy to keyboard the data form : I need to work with INNER JOIN , but the interface won't allow me to exec two SQL statments . 

- That was really interesting technical task ! Thanks for letting me the chance to try it ! 
- I can't continue because to be honest my laptop is pretty low config , so docker killed my machine haha
