------------------------------------------ AWS SERVICES MAY BE USED ---------------------------------------------------

-  When takling csv's , we need a S3 bucket to store huge data on the cloud , not on our database !
- AWS allow us to read and write to those csv files , that's why I strongly suggest AWS Glue to read and write from csv
- We can use AWS DynamoDb as database
- I have tried AWS amplify for content management that provide a whole full stack app , by having admin panel to control
